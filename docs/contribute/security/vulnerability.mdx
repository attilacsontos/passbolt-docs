# How to report a vulnerability

If you've found a security-related issue with Passbolt, please email security@passbolt.com. Do not submit the vulnerability to GitHub as this would make it public and potentially exploitable. We'll do a public disclosure of the security issue once it's been fixed.

## What happens after you report

After receiving a report, Passbolt will take the following steps:

1. Confirmation that the issue has been received and that it's in the process of being addressed
2. Attempt to reproduce the problem and confirm the vulnerability
3. Prepare a patch/fix and associated automated tests
4. Release a new version of all the affected versions
5. Prominently announce the problem in the release notes
6. If requested, give credit to the reporter

## What to include in your report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if available)
- Your contact information

## Responsible disclosure

We appreciate your help in keeping Passbolt secure. By following responsible disclosure practices, you help us protect our users while we work on a fix. We commit to:

- Acknowledging receipt of your report within 48 hours
- Keeping you informed of our progress
- Giving you credit for your findings (if desired)
- Not taking legal action against you for your research
