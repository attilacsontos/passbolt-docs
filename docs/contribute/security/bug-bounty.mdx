## Overview

Passbolt runs a bug bounty program to reward security researchers who help us identify and fix security vulnerabilities. We believe in working with the security community to make Passbolt more secure.

## Scope

The bug bounty program covers the following components:

- Passbolt API
- Passbolt Browser Extension

## Rewards

Rewards are based on the severity of the vulnerability and the quality of the report. We use the [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/) scoring system to determine severity.

### Reward Tiers

|----------|------------|--------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| High     | 7.0 - 8.9  | $500 - $1,000 |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9  | $100 - $500 |
| Low      | 0.1 - 3.9  | $50 - $100 |
