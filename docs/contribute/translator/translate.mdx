There are many ways to contribute to Passbolt, and one of them is to help translate the application into your language. 
Contributions are always welcome, and different tasks can be addressed depending on your profile. As a translator you 
could help translate strings or [proofread](/contribute/translator/proofread) the translated strings. As a technical profile 
you could help identify missing translations and [externalise](/contribute/translator/externalize) them in the source code.

## General guidelines

### Source language

Passbolt has been developed in British English and so this language is not considered as a language to translate
Passbolt into. If you discovered an error in this language or a string not available for translation:
- and you have a technical profile please refer to the [how to externalise strings](/contribute/translator/externalize) section.
- or you do not have a technical profile, please [open a ticket](https://community.passbolt.com/c/translation-issues) on 
  the community forum.

### Tone of voice

It depends mainly on the language, but translators should always keep in mind that the application shouldn't offend its
users. By instance, in French "*you*" can be translated in two different manners, the chosen form defines the relationship
one person has with another, and choosing the wrong form can be perceived negatively. In the French context the
translation should always prefer the use of the formal formulation such as "*vous*" for "*you*".

### Inclusion

Inclusion is a Passbolt value. Translations which exclude people based on their gender, ethnicity or any discriminative
attributes must be avoided. Neutral formulation should always be preferred when possible. For example, we use "*they*" 
instead of "*she*" or "*he*". While this might not always be possible in your language, try to find a gender-neutral 
form.

## Getting started with translation

The translation of Passbolt is entirely managed by CrowdIn and everybody can access it to propose a contribution.

### Connect to CrowdIn

You will need first to create a CrowdIn account or connect with a third party account (Google, GitHub ...) to be able 
to contribute to the translations. Go to [https://passbolt.crowdin.com](https://passbolt.crowdin.com) and sign in or 
sign up if you don't have an account yet.

### Select your language

Find the language you want to contribute to on the CrowdIn Passbolt project page at 
[https://passbolt.crowdin.com/passbolt](https://passbolt.crowdin.com/passbolt).

If your language is missing, and you would like to promote it, please 
[open a ticket](https://community.passbolt.com/c/translation-issues) on the community forum.

:::note
Passbolt is currently translated only in French, however other languages such as German and Spanish are 
already in the works and will soon be available for translators and proofreaders.

### Translate strings or fix a translation error

Once you have selected your language, you will be redirected to the CrowdIn translation editor.

**Select** a string that is not yet translated (<span style={{color: 'red'}}>&#9632;</span>) in the left panel &#9312;. You 
can of course have access to all translated strings (<span style={{color: 'green'}}>&#9632;</span>) in the very same panel if 
you want to propose another translation.

**Translate** the selected string from the central panel &#9313;. CrowdIn will propose you suggestions &#9314; 
to help translate but also to align with the tone and choice of words used in the application (suggestions marked 
with Passbolt's Translation memory).

If the strings to be translated are not clear you can **request a context** &#9315;, the community or a translation 
manager will answer your question and can provide you with a screenshot where the strings are used if necessary.

**Access to the glossary** or **translation memory** search tools are available if necessary in the right panel &#9316; 
of the application.
