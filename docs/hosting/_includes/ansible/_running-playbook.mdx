## Running the Ansible playbook
When you set all the necessary variables and configured the hosts, you will be able to run the Ansible playbook.

In the main directory file, you can run:

<CodeBlock>
  {`ansible-playbook -i $YOUR_INVENTORY install.yml`}
</CodeBlock>

After running the playbook, it should display one of multiple registration URLs based on your hosts file. In the example below, passbolt has been installed on a Debian 12 server and is prompting the URL:
<>
  {props.productName === 'PRO' ? (
    <CodeBlock>
      {`TASK [passbolt : Complete the administrator registration on a web browser] ***************************************************

ok: [YOUR_SERVER_IP] => {
    "msg": "In order to complete your full admin registration, please navigate to https://pro.debian12.local/setup/start/089c209e-5518-4240-997d-b1c354e2a450/13067e51-fc61-49ce-b8de-54f5d3fad43e"
}`}
    </CodeBlock>
  ) : (
    <CodeBlock>
      {`TASK [passbolt : Complete the administrator registration on a web browser] ***************************************************

ok: [YOUR_SERVER_IP] => {
    "msg": "In order to complete your full admin registration, please navigate to https://ce.debian12.local/setup/start/089c209e-5518-4240-997d-b1c354e2a450/13067e51-fc61-49ce-b8de-54f5d3fad43e"
}`}
    </CodeBlock>
  )}
</>

You will need to copy this URL and paste it to your web browser, then you can follow the next instructions.
