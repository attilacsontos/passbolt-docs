This page should give you the information necessary to successfully use [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) with your Passbolt installation.

For more information you can learn about secrets for [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#secrets) and [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)

## Supported environment variables

List of [environment variables](/hosting/configure/https/) that can be received as Docker secret and the matching Docker secret path environment variable:

## Supported secret files

List of file that contains secret data and the matching Docker secret path environment variable:
| FILE PATH                                |  DOCKER SECRET ENV VAR                                                    |

| /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.key           | PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_KEY_FILE                                              |

## Examples

### Inject DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD variable usign Docker secrets

Following the Docker secrets documentation for Docker compose we have the following docker-compose.yaml example:

```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
     secrets:
       - db_password
     ...

secrets:
   db_password:
     file: db_password.txt
```

In this example we want to inject the contents of `db_password.txt` in the `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable inside the Passbolt container.

To do so we create the secret and call it db_password in this snippet:

```yaml
secrets:
   db_password:
     file: db_password.txt
```

Once we have this, we use this secret on the Passbolt service:

```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     secrets:
       - db_password
     ...
```

Finally, we have to check which environment variable we have to set in order to get the contents of the secret file in the `DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` var. So we check in the Supported environment variables section to get the correct variable (`DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` in this case) and set it on the Passbolt container environment with the path that points to the secret name:

```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
```

### Inject /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem file using Docker secrets

```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE: /run/secrets/ssl_cert
     secrets:
       - ssl_cert
     ...

secrets:
   ssl_cert:
     file: ssl_cert.pem
```

In this example we want to inject the contents of `ssl_cert.pem` in the `/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem` file inside the Passbolt container.

To do so, we create a Docker secret and call it ssl_cert with the contents of `ssl_cert.pem`:

```yaml
secrets:
   ssl_cert:
     file: ssl_cert.pem
```

Then we inject the secret in the Passbolt service:

```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     secrets:
       - ssl_cert
     ...
```

And finally, we go to the supported secret files section to get which environment variable is the one that points to the path I want to fill (`PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE` which points to `/etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt`):

```yaml
services:
   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_SSL_SERVER_CERT_FILE: /run/secrets/ssl_cert
```

### Create secret outside of compose file

You can also create secrets directly so that you donâ€™t have to retain the file with the secret. This example will show you how to do that.

The first step here is to create the secret:

`docker secret create gpg-public public.key`

You will then need to modify your compose file to designate this as an external secret:

```yaml
secrets:
   gpg-public:
     external: true
```

Finally you will need to make sure this secret is used by the Passbolt service:

```yaml
services:

   passbolt:
     ...
     environment:
       PASSBOLT_GPG_SERVER_KEY_PUBLIC_FILE: /run/secrets/gpg-public
     secrets:
       - gpg-public
     ...
```
