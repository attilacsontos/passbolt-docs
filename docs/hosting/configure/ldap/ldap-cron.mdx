## Automating Directory Sync with Cron

To keep your [user directory](/admin/provisioning/users-directory/) in sync automatically, youâ€™ll need to schedule a cron job on your server.  
We recommend running it once per day, but you can adjust the frequency as needed.

---

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
0 0 * * * su -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake directory_sync all --persist" -s /bin/bash www-data >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

---

### RHEL / CentOS / RPM-based Systems

```bash
0 0 * * * su -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake directory_sync all --persist" -s /bin/bash nginx >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

> Replace `nginx` with the actual web server user if your environment differs.

---

### Docker

If you're using the official Docker deployment, uncomment the relevant cron lines in your Docker Compose file:

- [Lines 36â€“37 of `docker-compose-pro.yaml`](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose-pro.yaml#L36)

These lines enable the sync cron task within the containerized environment.

---

Once configured, your directory sync will run automatically based on the schedule youâ€™ve defined.

## Looking for More Advanced Scenarios?

This page provides basic examples for setting up cron jobs in both **Package** and **Docker** environments.

If you're working with more complex directory configurationsâ€”such as:

- multi-domain forests,
- synchronization of deleted users or complex permission structures,
- skipped entries, pagination handling, or memory limitations during syncs,

we recommend referring to the dedicated guide on advanced LDAP scenarios:

ðŸ‘‰ [**Advanced Directory Options**](/admin/provisioning/users-directory/advanced-directory-options/)

That resource offers in-depth guidance on large-scale environments, directory-specific quirks, and edge cases, and serves as the single source of truth for advanced provisioning setups.
