# Allow Content Types

This section controls which content types (e.g., Password, TOTP) can be used with encrypted or cleartext metadata when creating new resources.

## Configuration Options

### Encrypted Metadata Content Types

Each content type can be individually enabled or disabled:

- **Password**
- **TOTP**

:::note
These checkboxes are only available if "Enable Encrypted Metadata" is turned on in the [Encrypted Metadata](./encrypted-metadata.mdx) settings.
:::

### Legacy Cleartext Metadata Content Types

Each content type can be individually enabled or disabled:

- **Password**
- **TOTP**

:::note
These checkboxes are only available if "Enable Legacy Cleartext Metadata" is turned on in the [Encrypted Metadata](./encrypted-metadata.mdx) settings.
:::

:::warning
If the global toggle for legacy cleartext metadata is off, these options are visible but disabled, and the UI shows:
"Creation of content type v4 is not allowed."

## Important Considerations

:::caution
Legacy metadata formats are deprecated and not recommended for new resources. Use only during transition or migration phases.
:::

To enable the creation of resources with encrypted metadata:
1. Enable encrypted metadata in the [Encrypted Metadata](./encrypted-metadata.mdx) settings
2. Generate a metadata key in the [Metadata Key](./manage-metadata-key.mdx) settings
3. Enable the desired content types on this page
