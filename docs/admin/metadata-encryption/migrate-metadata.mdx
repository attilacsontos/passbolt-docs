## Configuration Options

### Items to Migrate

Toggle whether to include resource metadata in the migration. When enabled, the following fields will be encrypted:

- **Name**
- **Username**
- **URI**
- **Cleartext Description**

If disabled, these fields remain in cleartext form. Passwords are always encrypted regardless of this setting.

### Migration Scope

Choose which types of resources to include in the migration:

- **All content** - Includes both shared and personal resources.
- **Shared content only** - Only shared resources are migrated.

## Important Considerations

Before initiating migration, ensure:
- Encrypted metadata is enabled in the [Encrypted Metadata](./encrypted-metadata.mdx) settings
- A shared metadata key has been generated in the [Metadata Key](./manage-metadata-key.mdx) settings
- All users who need access to the migrated resources have received the shared metadata key

:::tip Best Practice
Always perform a complete backup before starting the migration process. This ensures you can recover if any issues occur during migration.

:::warning
Migrating content to encrypted metadata might affect integrations that rely on accessing resource metadata in cleartext format.
