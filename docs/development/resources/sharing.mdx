In this guide, we will walk through how to share a resource to another user.

For this guide, we will use a resource with an ID of `fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce`.

## Finding users and groups

In order to share something, we need to know who to share it with.

For that, we can query the `/share/search-aros.json` endpoint, which returns both groups and users.
We want to get the public key of the users in the response, so we set `contain[gpgkey]` to `1`.

```json
{
  "header": {
    "id": "663fc9f2-0bc6-46db-b867-a30ca125fd72",
    "status": "success",

    {

      },
      "last_logged_in": null
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint gives us the ID and public key for the person we want to share this resource with: Betty.

## Simulating the sharing operation

Before sharing the resource for real, we first want to check that the operation is feasible and sound.

With the precedent request, we know that Betty's user ID is `c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423`.

The payload we want to send for the simulation is the following:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "is_new": true,
      "aro": "User",
      "aro_foreign_key": "c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423",
      "type": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, we are requesting an permission creation (`"is_new": true`),
for a `User` with the ID `c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423`,
and a type of `7` (corresponding to "update").

This is now to be sent as the body of a `POST` request to the `/share/simulate/{foreignModel}/{foreignId}.json` endpoint.
Here, the `foreignModel` is a `resource` with a `foreignId` of `fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce`, so the final URL is `/share/simulate/resource/fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce.json`.

The response will look something like this:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "id": "ec8de673-1f04-4d8e-a25d-4083a1afb0aa",
    "status": "success",
    "servertime": 1726150498,
    "action": "7df37cb5-cfb9-57c2-a7a5-b65c9f573de0",
    "message": "The operation was successful.",
    "url": "/share/simulate/resource/fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce.json",
    "code": 200
  },
  "body": {
    "changes": {
      "added": [
        {
          "User": {
            "id": "c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423"
          }
        }
      ],
      "removed": []
    }
  }
}
```

The simulation is a `success`, and tells us that we are about to remove no permission, and add an access for Betty, which is exactly what we want to do.

## Sharing the resource

Now that we know that the share operation will likely succeed, we can do it for real.

We can reuse the previous payload as a base, but as we are adding a permission,
we need to add the corresponding secret, or else Betty couldn't read the said resource.

The `secrets` part of the payload has the same structure as the one for the update operation, leading to a final payload that looks like this:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "is_new": true,
      "aro": "User",
      "aro_foreign_key": "c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423",
      "type": 7
    }
  ],
  "secrets": [
    {
      "user_id": "c48863da-32d3-48cd-9d47-de2891386423",
      "data": "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----"
    }
  ]
}
```

This final payload is to be sent as the body of a `PUT` request to ``.

The API replies with the following body:

```json
{
    "header": {
        "id": "b7dd5022-a69a-448c-a1b5-38ad7d9bf364",
        "status": "success",
        "servertime": 1726152104,
        "action": "f3b4bd12-9d43-5749-a5fe-425c4cfe3ccb",
        "message": "The operation was successful.",
        "url": "/share/resource/fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce.json",
        "code": 200
    },
    "body": null
}
```

This is a success, congratulations for sharing your first resource! ðŸŽ‰
