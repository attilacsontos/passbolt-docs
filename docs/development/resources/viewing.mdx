In this guide, we will walk through how to view a resource using the Passbolt API.

## Viewing a resource

Let's say we want to find a resource we created, and it is named "Nextcloud".

We need to make a `GET` request to `/resources.json` to get a list of all the resources we have access to.
Because we want to get some information about how the resource data is structured, we will set the `contain[resource-type]` parameter to `1`.
We also want to update it later in this walk-through, so we will set a parameter to tell the API to send us the secrets as well, such as `contain[secret]` to `1`.

The final request URL looks something like this: `/resources.json?contain[resource-type]=1&contain[secret]=1`.

The server replies with something that looks like this:

```json

  "header": {
    "id": "d5ba6e4f-f0de-459c-9a9e-e724eb4a97f3",

                ]

              },
              "description": {
                "anyOf": [
                  {
                    "type": "string",
                    "maxLength": 10000
                  },
                  {
                    "type": "null"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "created": "2024-07-02T16:07:22+00:00",
        "modified": "2024-07-02T16:07:22+00:00"
      },
      "secrets": [
        {
          "id": "ab793b77-bd48-4a0f-b68a-9bc191eb0f58",
          "user_id": "8bb80df5-700c-48ce-b568-85a60fc3c8f2",
          "resource_id": "fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce",
          "data": "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----...",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The request was a success, as indicated by the `status` field in the header, and the API returned an array containing the resource we created in [another part of this guide](../creating).

We can now decrypt the secret associated to our account ID, `8bb80df5-700c-48ce-b568-85a60fc3c8f2`. ðŸŽ‰

Now that we know the resource ID, we can query information about it through a more specific endpoint, by making a `GET` request to `/resources/fc11887b-aaa6-4600-a460-e05e99c75bce.json`, which only returns information for the resource having this specific ID.
This way, we don't need to parse and manipulate unneeded resources, so we save some CPU cycles for both our client and our server.

Congratulations, you just queried a resource! ðŸŽ‰
