In this guide, we will walk through the creation of a resource which would contain an encrypted password and an encrypted description.

## Choosing a resource type

In order to create a resource, we need to choose a resource type, which will influence how data will be stored and managed around the resource.

A list of all the different resource types and their expected structure is available at `/resource-types.json`.

For this guide, we will use the `password-and-description` resource type,
as it is the default for Passbolt and is used for storing a password and a description, both encrypted.

The corresponding description of said resource type is similar to this JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "669f8c64-242a-59fb-92fc-81f660975fd3",
  "slug": "password-and-description",
  "name": "Password with description",
  "description": "A resource with the password and the description encrypted.",
  "definition": {
    "resource": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "name"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "maxLength": 255
        },
        "username": {
          "anyOf": [
            {
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 255
            },
            {
              "type": "null"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uri": {
          "anyOf": [
            {
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 1024
            },
            {
              "type": "null"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "secret": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "password"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "password": {
          "type": "string",
          "maxLength": 4096
        },
        "description": {
          "anyOf": [
            {
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 10000
            },
            {
              "type": null
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "created": "2024-07-08T08:06:25+00:00",
  "modified": "2024-07-08T08:06:25+00:00"
}
```

Under the `definition` key in this JSON object is a description of the allowed and required fields in both the resource and the secret entities.
Here, we can see that the `name` field is required, and the `username` and `uri` fields are allowed, and nullable, with the expected data format associated.
The secret is an armored string of an encrypted JSON object with a required `password` field, and a nullable `description` field.

We take note of the resource type ID as it will be used for the next step.

## Building the payload

In order to create a resource using the Passbolt API, we have to first build a payload that represents the said resource, so the server can be able to store it.

As discovered earlier, the `resource_type_id` for a `password-and-description` on our instance is `669f8c64-242a-59fb-92fc-81f660975fd3`.
Please use your own resource type ID as it changes from an instance to another.

As the `name` field is required, we will set it.
For the sake of this guide, we will create a password for a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance, so the `uri` field is set accordingly.

At this point, our basic payload looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Nextcloud",
    "resource_type_id": "669f8c64-242a-59fb-92fc-81f660975fd3",
    "uri": "https://nextcloud.com"
}
```

We now have to build the secret associated to this resource.

Only the `password` field is required, as seen earlier, but we want to add a description.

We now have something like this:

```json
{
    "password": "Correct Horse Battery Staple",
    "description": "My personal cloud storage"
}
```

We then encrypt and sign this data with our own key.
The resulting armored string, which begins with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`, will be the secret that we will send to the server.

Our final payload looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Nextcloud",
    "resource_type_id": "669f8c64-242a-59fb-92fc-81f660975fd3",
    "uri": "https://nextcloud.com",
    "secrets": [
        {
            "data": "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----..."
        }
    ]
}
```

### Making the request

The previously-built payload is now sent to the Passbolt's API, in the body of a `POST` request.

In this example, we sent the request to `/resources.json?api-version=v2&contain[permission]=1&contain[favorite]=1` so the response will contain all the relevant information needed for displaying the newly-created resource.

The API replies with this:

```json
{
    "header": {
        "id": "b1c3efc3-8995-49b2-a99f-45ac674fa1ae",
        "status": "success",
        "servertime": 1726071019,
        "action": "ad8bbc35-6435-538e-b1a7-80b87bcedb6a",
        "message": "The resource has been added successfully.",
        "url": "/resources.json?api-version=v2&contain[permission]=1&contain[favorite]=1",
        "code": 200
    },

            "modified": "2024-09-11T16:10:18+00:00"
        }
    }
}
```

The `success` status in the header tells us that the creation was successful, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
