### Passbolt is an open source credential manager designed for collaboration.

Passbolt addresses the challenge of securely managing and sharing credentials within organizations, ensuring
sensitive information remains protected while facilitating efficient collaboration and access management.

In short, it allows users to securely store, share, and manage their passwords and other sensitive information,
such as notes and OTP credentials using end to end encryption. Passbolt ensures that only authorised users have
access to the stored data. It also provides built-in security features like password generation and anti-phishing
mechanisms.

With its user-friendly interface and robust security measures, Passbolt empowers organisations to efficiently
organise and protect their passwords, secrets and credentials.
