  The API allows you to know more about the schema of a given resource and itâ€™s associated secret.

  In passbolt, passwords are split into two different entities: Resources (the metadata in clear) and Secrets (the encrypted data). The resource types define what is included in the resource and what is included in the secret. This definition, that is part of the resource type, takes the form of JSON schemas.

  Since passbolt is end-to-end encrypted the server cannot validate the content of the secrets. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the clients to check if the secret is deserializable according to the resource type schema associated with the resource and to choose how to handle that case.
