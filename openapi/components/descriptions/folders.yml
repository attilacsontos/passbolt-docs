  The API allows you to create, update, delete, and share folders.

  Folders can be either shared or personal. Whether they are personal or shared depends on their permissions. One folder (or resource) can only be in one folder for a given user perspective. However, a folder can be in multiple parent folder if you look at all users as a whole. This is to allow users to re-organize folders shared with them in a way that makes sense to them.

  A given folder visibility in the tree is therefore dependent on multiple factors, including if the parent folder is also shared.

  You can learn more about the folder dynamics in [this dedicated blog post](https://www.passbolt.com/blog/introducing-the-new-folders-feature).
