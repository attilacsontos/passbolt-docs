  The API allows you to create, update, delete, and share your passwords. You can list of all your passwords as well as retrieve individual passwords.

  In passbolt, passwords are split into two different entities: Resources and Secrets. The Resource entity is an object which represents a passwordâ€™s metadata and contains items such as the searchable password name, the associated username, the URL where the password is used, in addition to other fields.

  The Secret entity is the actual password and optionally other secret information such as the encrypted description. Secrets can be accessed via its associated Resource object or individually. In either case, the access will be logged in the system.

  The definition of what is included in the resource and what is included in the secret is described using resource types which take the form of JSON schemas.
