  User are entities with the ability to interact with the application. They are usually represented by one person and have a unique username (which is also their e-mail address). The `User` object returned by the API hence contains the relevant associated fields like `gpg_keys`, `roles`, `profile`, `avatar`, etc.

add: |
  Only users with `admin` role can create other users.

update: |
  Neither the email or the username field which can be updated.

  A user can update themselves. Then can change their first name and last name but not their role. An administrator can update their role. No one can update the username. If a user need to change their username, they will need to create a new user for this given email.

delete: |
  Only a user with an administrator role can delete users. A `user` can not be deleted as long as:

  - They are the sole owner of a shared resource.
  - They are a manager of a non empty group.

  In this case you will need to transfer the ownership of the shared resources and appoint a new manager to the group in order to proceed.
